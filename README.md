# 3D Visualisation

## Introduction

This is a 3D simulation program that I developed to understand the mathematical areas of matrices and vectors more fluently, learned in sixth form.
You can set up various objects in the 3D coordinate system, such as lines and triangles, to build essentially anything.
Upon adjusting the angle and position of the camera, my aim is to be able to appropriately map the 3D objects specified onto the 2D display.
