This is a 3D visualisation program that I am making to understand the mathematical areas of matrices and vectors more fluently.
By setting up various objects in the 3D coordinate system, such as lines and triangles, by adjusting the angle and position of the camera,
my aim is to be able to appropriately map the 3D objects specified onto the 2D display.
