# 3D Visualisation by Syba27

##Introduction <h2>
This is a 3D visualisation program that I am making to understand the mathematical areas of matrices and vectors more fluently.
One can set up various objects in the 3D coordinate system, such as lines and triangles, and generally you can make essentially anything with triangles (and patience). 
Upon adjusting the angle and position of the camera, my aim is to be able to appropriately map the 3D objects specified onto the 2D display.

## How does it work?
